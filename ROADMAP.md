# Roadmap

_Last updated: 2026-05-28_ (tick 31)

## Now
_In flight — actively being worked on. Keep this to 1–3 items._

### PWA / install + offline weekend cache
- **Why:** Mobile-first weekend use case is the canonical PWA fit; the mobile FAB from `9754dda` shows the pattern is working. Unlocks the "Friday-AM weekend reminder push" Later item, which is blocked on PWA shipping. Manifest already exists at `public/manifest.webmanifest` and is linked from `index.html`, but no service worker is registered and PNG icons (`icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`) exist on disk but aren't referenced — so installability is broken even though most of the scaffolding is there.
- **Effort:** M (1–2 days)
- **Links:** `public/manifest.webmanifest` (exists, SVG-only icons), `index.html:18` (manifest link), `public/icon-192.png` + `public/icon-512.png` (orphaned), `9754dda` (mobile FAB pattern)
- **Tasks:**
  - [x] Decide PWA scope + caching strategy. Write `docs/decisions/05-pwa-offline.md` covering: (a) what "offline weekend" means concretely — cache the current metro's `events.json` + `featured-plans.json` + spot detail JSON, or only the app shell?, (b) service worker library choice (Workbox vs. hand-rolled — repo already builds with Vite, so `vite-plugin-pwa` is the obvious default), (c) cache versioning + invalidation strategy (event data rotates weekly; need a `stale-while-revalidate` story that doesn't serve last-week's events), (d) install-prompt UX — passive (browser-driven) vs. an explicit "Install FamHop" button somewhere near the mobile FAB. <2h. _(dc5d887)_
  - [x] Fix the manifest to be actually installable. Add the existing `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` PNG entries to `public/manifest.webmanifest` (Chrome's installability check requires a 192+ PNG), verify `start_url` and `scope` against current routing, and add a `display_override` if the ADR calls for it. Run Lighthouse PWA audit locally to confirm "Installable" passes. _(f85385a)_
  - [x] Scaffold the service worker. Add `vite-plugin-pwa` (or chosen equivalent) to `vite.config.ts`, generate `sw.js` at build, register it from `src/main.tsx` behind a feature flag or a `import.meta.env.PROD` guard so dev isn't disrupted. Confirm SW shows up in DevTools → Application on a production build. _(fada638)_
  - [x] Implement the offline cache strategy from the ADR. `workbox.runtimeCaching` in `vite.config.ts` now matches the ADR §(a) table: `StaleWhileRevalidate` for per-metro `events`/`featured-plans` JSON (6h, `famhop-events-v1`) and `spots` JSON (30d, `famhop-spots-v1`), `CacheFirst` for OSM tiles + Unsplash/Wikimedia imagery (30d, `famhop-images-v1`), plus a `navigateFallback` SPA shell so visited routes hard-reload offline. Patterns match on the `/data/<metro>/…json` path (prod serves it cross-origin from `famhop-data.pages.dev`) and anchor to `.json$` so `?nocache=1` falls through to network. Verified: build emits all three caches + NavigationRoute into `dist/sw.js`; 213 tests pass. _(Note: dedicated `public/offline.html` for **un**visited metros — ADR §(d) case 2 — deferred; the SPA fallback covers the task's "visited metro, reload offline" verification.)_
  - [x] Add the install-prompt UX from the ADR. `src/installPrompt.ts` captures `beforeinstallprompt` at import time (before React mounts), stashes the deferred event, and tracks gating in per-origin `localStorage` (`famhop:visits` ≥2, `famhop:install:dismissedAt` 30-day window, `famhop:install:installed`, not-standalone). `src/InstallBanner.tsx` is a mobile-only bottom bar mounted from `App.tsx` (so it never shows on `/ops`); Android/desktop tap "Install" → native prompt, iOS Safari taps "Show me how" → Share→Add-to-Home-Screen modal. CSS lifts the Hop-now FAB above the banner. Verified in a mobile preview: banner shows when eligible, "Not now" persists + hides, 30-day window suppresses re-trigger, FAB un-overlaps. tsc + 213 tests pass.
  - [ ] Write a smoke test or document a manual QA checklist for PWA install across iOS Safari (Add to Home Screen), Android Chrome (install prompt), and desktop Chrome. iOS doesn't fire `beforeinstallprompt` so confirm the manifest alone gives a reasonable A2HS experience.

## Next
_Committed, not yet started. Ordered by priority. Aim for ≤5 items._

### Free-text search across spots + events
- **Why:** Current discovery is filter-only; a known ceiling for browse-style apps as the dataset grows.
- **Effort:** M

### UI/component tests
- **Why:** `tests/` covers pipeline + planner, but nothing exercises `App.tsx`, `auth.ts`, or the plans view; React refactors are unsafe.
- **Effort:** M

## Later
_Candidates and ideas. Unordered. No commitment._

- **Weekend reminder push (Fri-AM "your weekend is set")** — retention play that pairs sign-in (`1d3ae14`) with Hop-me-now; depends on PWA shipping first. _Effort: M (after PWA)._
- **NightHop content/parity audit** — `deploy:adults` and the `audiences` arrays exist, but it's unclear how much adult-specific surface there is vs. just filtered kid data. _Effort: S audit → L close gaps._
- **Repo cleanup: root-level screenshots + tracked drift** — ~35 PNG screenshots at repo root, plus ~50 files of routine event-data drift in the working tree. _Effort: XS._
- **Newsletter: activate live sends** — code is shipped; needs Resend account creation, DNS verification of `famhop.com`, `RESEND_API_KEY` + `NEWSLETTER_ADMIN_TOKEN` wrangler secrets, then a real test send to an operator address with Gmail + Apple Mail QA. Pure ops work, not a code task — promote back to Now only once the human has completed the external setup.
