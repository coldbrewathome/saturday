- duration: 5s
- transition_in: push-slide LEFT
- status: built
- src: compositions/frames/05-the-map.html
- type: feature_showcase
- persuasion: Statistical proof
- beat: confidence
- blueprint: camera-journey (Adapt — sub-shape B, cursorless flight)
- focal: assets/scroll-000.png
- roles: scroll-000.png = background (full-bleed product screen — **do NOT dim it**; it is the evidence of the beat and must stay fully legible)
- sfx: none
- on_screen: "1,582 SPOTS — IN THE BAY AREA ALONE." (counts up) · small mono label "EDITOR'S PICKS NEAR THIS VIEW"
- asset_candidates: assets/scroll-000.png — the captured full product screen: filter rail, clustered map pins, the editor's-picks carousel

narrativeRole: Scale within one metro. The captured screen does the work — this is the frame where the viewer sees the actual product rather than a designed abstraction of it.
keyMessage: The whole metro is already mapped.

Adapt: keep the cursorless-cinematic-flight signature. Changed: the "world" is a single captured
still, so fly it as a flat plane inside the wireframe's ink-bordered screen block — scale and
translate the image, never fake 3D geometry.

Scene 1 (0.0–1.4s): the product screen fills its block at ~112% scale, framed on the filter rail; a slow lateral flight begins toward the pin cluster (`viewport-change`), the rail softening out of focus as it leaves frame (`depth-of-field-blur`). Full-bleed within the block, 3 depth layers.
Scene 2 (1.4–3.0s): the flight decelerates and locks framed on the clustered pins; the cluster badges pulse once as they come into focus (`svg-icon-enrichment`).
Scene 3 (3.0–4.2s): the berry marker-block slams in over the lower-right of the screen carrying the frame's one hard offset shadow (`spring-pop-entrance`), its figure counting 0 → 1,582 (`counting-dynamic-scale`).
Scene 4 (4.2–5.0s): the flight stops dead and the frame holds — no back-half re-push, no drift.

# Counting with Dynamic Scale

A number counts from A → B while its transform scale grows to the final size — escalating visual weight ("this is impressive") without tweening `font-size` or forcing text layout on every frame. The final font size is static CSS; only the transform changes.

## How It Works

Two synchronized tweens at the SAME timeline position with the SAME ease: (1) a proxy value rendered as text via `onUpdate` (`Math.round(...).toLocaleString()`), (2) the counter's transform `scale: START_SCALE → 1`, where `START_SCALE = START_SIZE / END_SIZE`. A suffix (`%`, `×`, `+`) slides in AFTER the count lands — the number gets its own beat — and a label fades in early.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="counter-wrap">
  <span class="counter" id="counter">0</span><span class="counter-suffix">{suffix}</span>
</div>
<div class="counter-label">{label}</div>
```

```css
.counter-wrap {
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  justify-content: center;
  width: {counterContainerWidth}; /* fixed width — no layout shift as digit count changes */
}
.counter {
  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; /* MANDATORY — digits keep equal width */
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: {endSize}; /* final size is static; GSAP animates scale, not font-size */
  transform-origin: center center;
}
.counter-suffix {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(20px);
}
```

```js
const counter = document.getElementById("counter");
const state = { value: 0 };
const START_SCALE = START_SIZE / END_SIZE;

// Count value — onUpdate changes text only
tl.to(
  state,
  {
    value: TARGET_VALUE,
    duration: COUNT_DUR,
    ease: COUNT_EASE,
    onUpdate: () => {
      counter.textContent = Math.round(state.value).toLocaleString();
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Visual growth — compositor transform sharing the count's timing + ease
tl.fromTo(counter, { scale: START_SCALE }, { scale: 1, duration: COUNT_DUR, ease: COUNT_EASE }, 0);

// Suffix slides in AFTER the count completes
tl.to(
  ".counter-suffix",
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUFFIX_DUR, ease: `back.out(${SUFFIX_BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  COUNT_DUR,
);

// Label fades in early
tl.from(".counter-label", { opacity: 0, y: 12, duration: LABEL_DUR, ease: "power2.out" }, LABEL_AT);
```

## Variations

- **Direct `innerText` tween (no proxy)** — GSAP can tween `innerText` directly for a number-only counter; keep the proxy form when you need locale formatting or suffix logic. The scale tween stays separate either way:

```js
tl.to(
  counter,
  { innerText: TARGET_VALUE, duration: COUNT_DUR, ease: COUNT_EASE, snap: { innerText: 1 } },
  0,
);
```

- **3D depth entry** — add a `tl.from(".counter", { z: -300, ... }, 0)` push-in; requires `perspective` on `.counter-wrap` and `transform-style: preserve-3d` on the counter.
- **Multi-stat coordinated reveal** — 3 stats counting in parallel share the SAME ease, duration, and start position so they finish together (a chord, not an arpeggio). Each stat usually also needs a paired graphic (bar / ring / stars) — don't stop at the number; see [stat-bars-and-fills.md](stat-bars-and-fills.md).

## Values

| START_SIZE / END_SIZE | START ≈ 40–60% of END                       | design inputs used once for START_SCALE; never tween either                   |
| COUNT_DUR             | 1.2–2.5s                                    | below ~0.8s reads as a flash — the eye must read the digits scrolling past    |
| COUNT_EASE            | `power2.out` / `power3.out` ⭐ / `expo.out` | shared by value + scale; more `.out` = more dramatic deceleration at the peak |
| SUFFIX_DUR            | 0.3–0.6s                                    | fires at `COUNT_DUR`, never during the count                                  |
| SUFFIX_BOUNCE_FACTOR  | 1.4–2.0                                     | overshoot is fine on the suffix (it's punctuation, not data)                  |
| LABEL_AT / LABEL_DUR  | AT < COUNT_DUR/2; 0.4–0.7s                  | label arrives before the count peaks                                          |

## Critical Constraints

- **`tabular-nums` mandatory** + fixed-width container as belt-and-suspenders — without them digit-count transitions (9 → 10 → 100) jitter as glyph widths change.
- **Never set `fontSize` in `onUpdate`** — final type size is static CSS; only the transform changes per frame. Keep `onUpdate` O(1): set text only, no style writes or DOM creation.
- **`Math.round`, not `Math.floor`** — halfway through the final integer should already display the final value.
- **Avoid `back.out` / `elastic.out` on the counter itself** — overshoot makes the number look unstable (it's data, not decoration). Grow in place, don't bounce.
- **Label is BIG TEXT, not a page-style caption** — a tiny paragraph under a hero-size number reads as visual noise in video. Display-size, uppercase, tracked: the label is part of the headline.

# Depth-of-Field Blur (Selective Focus / Rack Focus)

Pulls the eye to one focal element by **blurring** (and slightly **dimming**) everything around it while the focal layer stays sharp — the camera's depth-of-field falling off the background, or a rack-focus shifting which plane is in focus. `filter` and `opacity` are paint-only, so both tween seek-safe. This is the backing rule for the focus-falloff beat the blueprints reach for: outer nodes blurring during a push-in (`constellation-hub`), rack-focus across a parallax card stack (`cursor-ui-demo`), non-highlighted cards dimming to spotlight a hero metric (`dataviz-countup`).

## How It Works

Every layer carries a `--dof` custom property (px of blur), read by `filter: blur(var(--dof))`, plus its own `opacity`. A GSAP tween advances each layer's `--dof` from `0` to its target blur and its opacity from `1` to a dim level over the focus-shift window. The focal layer's `--dof` stays `0`. Per-layer targets derive from `data-depth` / index, so the falloff is identical on every seek.

Three mechanics, same primitive:

1. **Focal pull** — one window: off-focus layers go sharp(0) → blurred while the focal layer holds at 0. The eye is pulled to the only thing still crisp.
2. **Rack focus** — two adjacent windows on the same property: plane A's blur ramps 0 → max at the same position plane B's ramps max → 0. State continuity matters exactly as in `press-release-spring`: A's resting blur after the rack must equal what B held before it — author both as tweens on the same `--dof` at the same position so the hand-off is seamless.
3. **Blur-the-cluster-while-pushing-in** — the DoF tween runs at the SAME timeline position as a camera push-in (`multi-phase-camera` / `coordinate-target-zoom`): "the world recedes" and "we push in" read as one move.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="world" id="world">
  <!-- Focal layer — stays sharp -->
  <div class="layer focal" id="focal">{FocalLabel}</div>
  <!-- Off-focus layers — blur + dim; data-depth orders near→far -->
  <div class="layer ctx" data-depth="1">{Context A}</div>
  <div class="layer ctx" data-depth="2">{Context B}</div>
  <div class="layer ctx" data-depth="3">{Context C}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.world {
  /* single wrapper so a concurrent camera push-in transforms everything
     together; DoF is independent of the camera */
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%;
}
.layer {
  --dof: 0px; /* px of blur; filter reads it — starts sharp */
  filter: blur(var(--dof));
  will-change: filter; /* promotes the layer so per-frame re-rasterization is cheap */
}
.focal {
  z-index: 2; /* sharp layer must sit ABOVE the blurred ones, or its crisp
     edges read as bleeding into the haze */
}
.ctx {
  z-index: 1;
}
```

```js
// Mechanic 1 — FOCAL PULL. Blur scales with data-depth so far planes blur
// more than near ones; the focal layer (--dof: 0, opacity: 1) is untouched.
gsap.utils.toArray(".ctx").forEach((el) => {
  const depth = Number(el.dataset.depth) || 1;
  tl.to(
    el,
    {
      "--dof": `${BLUR_PER_DEPTH * depth}px`,
      opacity: DIM_LEVEL, // dim, not gone
      duration: FOCUS_DUR,
      ease: "power2.inOut",
    },
    FOCUS_START,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Rack focus between two depth planes** — `gsap.set` plane B pre-blurred BEFORE the rack (no pop), then two tweens sharing `RACK_START` + `RACK_DUR`: A → `MAX_BLUR` + `DIM_LEVEL`, B → `0px` + `1`. Shared window makes them cross at the midpoint.
- **Blur the cluster while pushing in** — run the focal-pull tweens at the same position + duration as a camera tween on `#world` (`scale/x/y`, `power2.inOut`). Camera transforms the world; DoF tweens the layers — independent property channels, no conflict.
- **Spotlight a hero metric in a card grid** — `gsap.utils.toArray(".card:not(.hero)")` all defocus (`GRID_BLUR` + `DIM_LEVEL`) on one shared window; heroes are skipped.
- **Refocus / settle** — if the beat resolves back to "everything visible" (or hands off to a crossfade needing a clean outgoing frame), ramp all `--dof` back to `0px` / opacity 1 over the tail (`REFOCUS_START + REFOCUS_DUR ≤ DURATION`).
- **Bounded focus-breathing on the focal layer (optional)** — a finite `ease:"none"` driver writes `Math.max(0, Math.sin(p)) * FOCAL_BREATH_PX` into the focal `--dof` during a hold. Keep it ≤ ~0.6px or it reads as "still focusing"; default to omitting it.

| FOCAL vs CTX sizing   | context smaller / grouped              | small context layers let a modest radius still read as "out of focus" — and blur cheaply                 |

Tokens: dark `{bgGradient}` so the sharp focal layer reads as lit and forward; heavy display `{font}` weight — blurred copy needs it to stay shape-legible.

## Critical Constraints

- **Tween the `--dof` variable on the timeline** — reading `filter: blur(var(--dof))` keeps the blur on the HF seek clock.
- **Blur the SMALL / GROUPED layers, not the giant one.** Filter cost scales with radius × pixel area; a 20 px blur on a full-frame background is the worst case. Keep per-layer radius ≤ ~24 px on large surfaces and lean on the `opacity` **dim** to do the push-back work — dim + modest blur reads more like real DoF than blur cranked to the max.
- **`will-change: filter`** on every layer whose blur animates (drop it after settle if the layer also does heavy transform work).
- **Focal layer stays genuinely sharp** — `--dof: 0`, untouched (or breathing ≤ 0.6 px). Any visible blur on the focal element kills the "this is the thing" read.
- **State continuity on a rack** — the outgoing plane starts at the blur the incoming plane was holding, and vice-versa; adjacent tweens on the same `--dof` at the same position.
- **DoF is independent of the camera** — blur the layers, transform `.world` for the push-in; don't fake DoF with the camera transform or vice-versa.
- **Settle sharp before a hand-off** — refocus to `--dof: 0` in the tail if the next beat is a crossfade/push; handing off mid-defocus reads as "the render glitched."
- **Sharp focal layer above blurred layers** (`z-index`).

# Spring-Pop Entrance

> **Smooth beats bouncy.** This entrance defaults to a smooth long-tail settle — `power3.out` (or `expo.out` for a faster front) — that decelerates cleanly into the resting size with **no overshoot**. Bouncy `back.out` is the **#1 instant turn-off** in agent-made videos and is almost never executed well; it is a rare, explicitly-playful exception (consumer / fun brand), never the default. When unsure, settle smoothly.

THE entrance primitive: an element (or staggered group) arrives by springing from nothing — `scale: 0 → 1`, optional small `y` rise — and settles without bouncing. This is **arrival**, not reaction: distinct from [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md) (a click/press → release feedback chain on an element that already rests on screen). Many blueprints used to borrow that rule to fake an entrance; reach for this instead.

## How It Works

One `fromTo` carries the whole arrival: from `{ scale: 0, opacity: 0 }` (explicit, so t=0 is correct under seek) to `{ scale: 1, opacity: 1, ease: "power3.out" }`. For a **group**, the same `fromTo` runs per element at `i * STAGGER`, capped so the group reads as one arriving beat. The `scale` grow is load-bearing; the `y` rise is garnish — drop everything else and it must still read as a clean entrance. Let the ease produce the settle: never hand-key a `scale: 1.1` mid-state (it double-bounces against the curve).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="pop-hero" id="hero">{heroLabel}</div>

<div class="pop-grid">
  <div class="pop-item">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.pop-hero,
.pop-item {
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* in-place pop; move to the source point for the anchored variation */
  will-change: transform;
}
.pop-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: GRID_GAP;
  place-items: center;
}
```

```js
// Single hero pop — smooth long-tail settle, no overshoot.
tl.fromTo(
  "#hero",
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0 },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  ENTRY_AT,
);

// Staggered group pop — one arriving beat.
gsap.utils.toArray(".pop-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { scale: 0, opacity: 0, y: Y_RISE },
    { scale: 1, opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
    GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Calm settle** (premium / enterprise): `power3.out`, no rotation, `Y_RISE` 0–12px — a weighted, confident landing for a hero wordmark or product shot.
- **Firm settle** (everyday default): `power3.out` or `expo.out` for a punchier front, `Y_RISE` ~24px — cards, icons, callouts.
- **Exact-physics settle**: when the settle IS the shot, swap the ease for `springEase({ response: 0.4 })` (critically damped) from `../adapters/gsap-easing-and-stagger.md` → Spring Eases; take `duration` from the helper.
- **Origin-anchored pop**: a callout growing out of a specific point (marker, pointer tip) sets `transform-origin` to that point (e.g. `0% 100%`) so `scale: 0 → 1` reads as "emerging from the source", not "inflating in place".
- **Pop into a held slot**: land the pop and hold still — no idle loop baked into the entrance. If the held frame genuinely needs life, hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) for subtle jitter on a separate later tween; prefer revealing the next element on its VO cue.
- **Bouncy pop (RARE — explicitly-playful only)**: swap the ease for `back.out(OVERSHOOT)` and optionally settle a small `rotation: ROT_FROM → 0` so elements look hand-placed. Only for a deliberately playful register — never product / enterprise / serious tone:

```js
tl.fromTo(
  el,
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0, rotation: ROT_FROM },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, rotation: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: `back.out(${OVERSHOOT})` },
  GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
);
```

Even here keep `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2` — past that it reads as cartoon wobble. Better still: the baked spring at `dampingFraction: 0.6–0.7` (same adapters doc) gives ~5–10% overshoot that reads physical where `back.out` reads cartoon.

## Critical Constraints

- `ITEM_COUNT × STAGGER ≤ ~0.5s` — the group must land inside one beat.
- Entrances state the collapsed from-state in `fromTo` — never rely on a CSS-hidden start (it renders visible before the tween claims it under seek).
- `transform-origin: 50% 50%` for an in-place pop; the source point only for the anchored variation.
- This is a finite arrival — idle motion on a held element is a separate, later `sine-wave-loop` tween.

# SVG Icon Enrichment

Treats an SVG icon as a composition of animated PARTS, not an opaque image. Each meaningful internal element (a clock hand, scissor blade, recording dot, data line) gets its own micro-animation, targeted by id. Distinct from [svg-path-draw](svg-path-draw.md) (which animates the OUTLINE drawing) — enrichment animates INTERNAL PARTS, ideally after the outline has drawn.

Four signature patterns:

| Pattern     | Use For                            | Math                                  | Tip                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Rotation    | Clock, gear, loader, dial          | `rotate(deg cx cy)` attribute, linear | see the transform-center gotcha    |
| Oscillation | Scissors, wings, toggle            | `rotate(±sin·amp)` on opposing groups | opposite signs on the two parts    |
| Pulse       | Recording dot, heart, notification | `scale(1 + sin·amp)` + opacity        | ring lags dot by π/2 for ripple    |
| Dash flow   | Cutting line, data stream          | `strokeDashoffset` linear via time    | negative for L→R, positive for R→L |

## ❗ The transform-center gotcha

**For rotation around an explicit point inside an SVG, use the SVG `transform` ATTRIBUTE, not CSS transform**: `el.setAttribute("transform", `rotate(${deg} ${cx} ${cy})`)`. The CSS combination `transform: rotate(...)` + `transform-origin: 60px 60px` + `transform-box: fill-box` interprets the origin in the element's OWN **bbox-local** coordinates, NOT viewBox coordinates. For a thin `<line>` (whose bbox is the line's narrow envelope), `60 60` bbox-local is a point OUTSIDE the line — the hand flies along an off-center arc instead of rotating in place. Same trap for small inner shapes (a dot circle whose bbox is the small circle, not the full viewBox).

**Scaling around a center point**: same attribute route — `el.setAttribute("transform", `translate(${cx} ${cy}) scale(${s}) translate(-${cx} -${cy})`)`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip — named children are the animation targets -->

```

```js
// Pattern 1 — Rotation. Proxy tween → SVG transform attribute (explicit center, see gotcha).
const hand = document.getElementById("hand-min");
const minState = { deg: 0 };
tl.to(
  minState,
  {
    deg: 360 * MIN_REVOLUTIONS,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none", // linear motion is the point
    onUpdate: () => hand.setAttribute("transform", `rotate(${minState.deg} 60 60)`),
  },
  0,
);
// second hand: same shape with SEC_REVOLUTIONS (visibly faster).

// Pattern 3 — Pulse. One phase proxy drives dot + ring, ring offset by π/2.
const dot = document.getElementById("rec-dot");
const ring = document.getElementById("rec-ring");
const pulse = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  pulse,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * PULSE_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none", // sine handles the curve
    onUpdate: () => {
      const sD = 1 + Math.sin(pulse.p) * PULSE_DOT_AMP;
      const sR = 1 + Math.sin(pulse.p + Math.PI / 2) * PULSE_RING_AMP;
      dot.setAttribute("transform", `translate(60 60) scale(${sD}) translate(-60 -60)`);
      ring.setAttribute("transform", `translate(60 60) scale(${sR}) translate(-60 -60)`);
      ring.style.opacity = String(
        PULSE_RING_OPACITY_BASE + Math.sin(pulse.p) * PULSE_RING_OPACITY_AMP,
      );
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Pattern 4 — Dash flow. Linear offset tween on a dashed stroke.
const flowState = { offset: 0 };
tl.to(
  flowState,
  {
    offset: DASH_FLOW_TOTAL_OFFSET, // negative = L→R
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      document.getElementById("data-flow").style.strokeDashoffset = String(flowState.offset);
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Stroke draw → enrichment chain** — draw the outline first via [svg-path-draw](svg-path-draw.md) (phase 1, `0 → OUTLINE_DUR`), then start enrichment at `OUTLINE_DUR`: the icon "wakes up" after assembly.
- **Per-icon entry stagger** — for a row of icons, each icon's enrichment starts as it fades in, not synchronized.

| DASH_FLOW_TOTAL_OFFSET          | ±100–400             | must be an integer multiple of the dash period (dash + gap) or the end frame shows a phase jump |

## Critical Constraints

- **The transform-center gotcha above** — SVG `transform` attribute for any rotation/scale around an explicit interior point; never CSS `transform-origin` + `transform-box: fill-box` on thin lines or small inner shapes.
- **No `requestAnimationFrame`** — like CSS animation, it desyncs from HF's frame-by-frame seek; continuous motion lives inside the timeline as linear proxy tweens.
- **Amplitudes subtle** — icons are decorative, not headlines; calibrate rotation speed against composition length, not absolute time.
- **Phase-offset the parts** — minute vs second hand at different speeds, ring lagging dot by π/2. Pure sync looks mechanical.
- **`stroke-linecap: round`** on flowing/dashed lines for clean dash edges.
- **Climax dwell ≥1s** — if the enrichment is the headline beat, the composition continues ≥1s after the most dramatic moment.

# Viewport Change (Virtual Camera)

Simulates camera effects (zoom / pan / focus-lock on a moving element) by transforming a wrapper around ALL scene content. The "world" moves opposite to the perceived camera. Distinct from [multi-phase-camera](multi-phase-camera.md) (2-3 discrete phases + drift) — viewport-change is a single continuous zoom/pan, often used for focus-lock following a moving element.

## How It Works

Camera intent → world transform. Camera **pans right** → world `translateX(-distance)`; camera **zooms in** → world `scale(>1)`; camera **follows element X** → world `translateX(viewportCenter - elementWorldX)` per-frame. Get the sign right or everything moves the wrong way. The single `.world` wrapper holds the camera transform; elements inside are positioned in world space, unchanged.

**Single-element composite transform (this rule's form).** Both scale and translate live on ONE wrapper as `translate(x, y) scale(S)`. CSS applies scale FIRST, then translate (right-to-left matrix composition), so a point at world offset `(ox, oy)` lands on screen at `(S × ox + x, S × oy + y)`. To map the target to viewport center, solve `S × offset + T = 0`:

```
T = -offset × S
```

This is **different from [coordinate-target-zoom](coordinate-target-zoom.md)**, which uses two nested wrappers (outer scales, inner translates) and derives `T = -offset` (independent of S). Mixing up the two forms drifts the target off-center as scale changes. Use this single-wrapper form when you want one source of truth for camera state (`cam.scale`, `cam.x`, `cam.y`) written via `onUpdate`; use nested wrappers when scale and translate can tween independently with shared ease.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="world" id="world">
  <div class="content">
    <div class="hero">{Brand}</div>
    <div class="tagline">{tagline}</div>
    <div class="cta" id="cta">{ctaUrl}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — any non-1.0 scale reveals edges or pushes content off-frame */
  background: {bgGradient}; /* on .scene, NOT .world — a world-borne background warps with the camera */
}
.world {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* centered scaling is what the math assumes */
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
const world = document.getElementById("world");

// Camera state — single source of truth. The world transform is composed from
// this object in ONE place so the transform string order is stable.
const cam = { scale: 1, x: 0, y: 0 };
function applyCamera() {
  world.style.transform = `translate(${cam.x}px, ${cam.y}px) scale(${cam.scale})`;
}
applyCamera(); // seed frame 0

// Zoom in on the CTA: single-element composite transform → T = -offset × S.
// TARGET_OFFSET_Y is the target's measured offset from viewport center at
// neutral camera (sign matters — positive = below center).
const counterY = -TARGET_OFFSET_Y * TARGET_SCALE;

tl.to(
  cam,
  {
    scale: TARGET_SCALE,
    y: counterY,
    duration: ZOOM_DUR,
    ease: "power3.inOut",
    onUpdate: applyCamera,
  },
  ZOOM_START,

## Scale Value Guide

| Effect      | Scale       | Feel                                |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Subtle      | 1.02 - 1.05 | Barely perceptible — "professional" |
| Medium      | 1.05 - 1.15 | "Ta-da" emphasis                    |
| Noticeable  | 1.15 - 1.30 | Focus on region                     |
| Dramatic    | 1.5 - 2.5   | Element fills screen                |
| Full-screen | 3.0+        | Element covers viewport             |

Perception: < 5% scale change is imperceptible; 10-15% is comfortable emphasis; > 30% is cinematic/dramatic. For a natural product feel, prefer 1.05-1.15× over 2-3s; save big > 1.3× zooms for dramatic narrative moments.

### Extreme range — 4–12× outward (workspace reveal)

The same single-cam math runs far past the table: a zoom-out workspace reveal opens punched-in at **4–12×** on one detail (a single cell, message, or button) and pulls out to the full workspace in one continuous move. The mechanics don't change — one `cam` object, `T = -offset × S`, one `applyCamera()` writer — only the authoring direction does:

- **Build the workspace at its final (1×) layout and OPEN scaled-in** (`cam.scale = 8`, counter-translate aiming the opening detail; state it in a `fromTo` / seed via `applyCamera()` so a seek to t=0 lands punched-in). The wide landing frame is then everything at native design size — text crisp, raster assets at source resolution.
- **Never the inverse** — authoring the close-up at 1× and scaling the world down to 0.08–0.25 for the wide frame drops every label below legible pixel size and softens raster media; the reveal lands on mush.
- **Measure the opening target** — at S = 8, a 1 px error in the baked offset is 8 px on screen at the opening pose. Take the offset from the target's real laid-out center (`getBoundingClientRect` after `fonts.ready`, once at setup — the measuring doctrine in [coordinate-target-zoom.md](coordinate-target-zoom.md)), never from a layout formula.
- **The opening detail must survive ×S** — it renders at `S ×` its design size on the first frames (vector/DOM text is safe; raster needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × S`).

## Variations

- **Focus-lock (camera follows a moving cursor/character)** — keep the element at a fixed screen X by computing the world offset per-frame inside the driver's `onUpdate`:

```js
const focusEl = document.querySelector(".moving-cursor");
const targetScreenX = VIEWPORT_WIDTH * FOCUS_SCREEN_X_FRAC; // 0.4–0.7; 0.5 = dead center
const focusUpdate = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  focusUpdate,
  {
    p: 1,
    duration: FOLLOW_DUR, // matches how long the focused element is in motion
    ease: "power2.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const rect = focusEl.getBoundingClientRect();
      cam.x = targetScreenX - (rect.left + rect.width / 2);
      applyCamera();
    },
  },
  FOLLOW_START,
);
```

- **Composite scale (multi-phase)** — two proxy tweens multiplied through one writer: `cam.scale = scaleUp.v * scaleDown.v; applyCamera()`. Combine a slow push-in (~1.15) with a brief release (~0.9) for a breath/punch shape.
- **Camera mode transition (centered → follow)** — crossfade two camera modes via a 0→1 weight tween; intermediate frames interpolate between the modes' offsets.

## Critical Constraints

- **One `.world` wrapper carries the whole camera** — every scene element lives inside it; a second transformed wrapper is a second camera.
- **Single source of truth via the `cam` object + `applyCamera()`** — when scale and translate both change, write them in ONE place; never split them across tweens that touch `world.style.transform` directly (the transform string composition order becomes unpredictable).
- **Single-wrapper counter-translate is `T = -offset × S`** — don't import the nested-wrapper `T = -offset` formula.
- **`overflow: hidden` on `.scene`**; **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on `.world`**; **background on `.scene`, never on `.world`**.
