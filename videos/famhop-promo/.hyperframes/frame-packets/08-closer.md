- sfx: none
- on_screen: "PLAN ·" / "HOP ·" / "REPEAT." snapping in one at a time · then the famhop wordmark · "famhop.com" · a rotated stamp reading "16 METROS"
- asset_candidates: assets/logo-famhop.svg — the famhop wordmark

narrativeRole: The sign-off, on the one green ground frame.md reserves for exactly this beat. The tagline is the product's own; the URL is the ask.
keyMessage: famhop.com — go get your Saturday back.

Reproduce: the closing line snaps in beat by beat and lands on the wordmark and the URL.
**This is the final frame** — the only one permitted an exit, and it does not need one: let the URL
hold to the last rendered frame.

Scene 1 (0.0–0.4s): the forest-green plate is the ground from `t=0` (the run's only green frame); the berry stamp is already seated top-right at the brand −6° angle.
Scene 2 (0.4–2.2s): "PLAN ·", "HOP ·", "REPEAT." snap in one line per beat on hard cuts (`kinetic-beat-slam`), cream on green — the line count is the rhythm.
Scene 3 (2.2–3.6s): the famhop wordmark draws itself on beneath the tagline (`svg-path-draw`), the pin-o filling accent-orange last.
Scene 4 (3.6–5.0s): "famhop.com" lands under the wordmark on one beat and the frame settles into a full hold to the last frame. No exit tween.

# Kinetic Beat Slam

Short phrases hit one at a time on a **steady beat**, each with a _different_ entrance, then stack into a locked finale — the recipe for "punchy / rhythmic" text-forward pieces (taglines, manifestos, hype intros). The difference between generic and rhythmic is (1) one shared **onset array** driving every element, (2) **distinct** entrances per phrase rather than one reused helper, and (3) optional **rhythm chrome** that visibly keeps the beat.

## How It Works

A single tempo grid — `PULSE` seconds per sub-beat, `BEATS = [t0, t1, t2, …]` on that grid — is the rhythmic spine; every phrase entrance, accent, and chrome tick reads its time from it, so the piece locks to one pulse instead of drifting hand-tuned offsets. Each phrase gets a different transform axis (scale+blur slam / side snap / rise+rotate) with short attacks (0.35–0.6s on the hit), then the stack holds with a finite low-amplitude breath.

## Recipe

</div>
<!-- optional rhythm chrome -->
<div class="kbs-metronome" aria-hidden="true"><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i></div>
```

```css
.kbs-stage {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 120px 160px; /* title-safe margin */
}
.kbs-line {
  font-family: "Archivo Black", "League Gothic", sans-serif; /* embedded display face */
  font-size: 150px;
  line-height: 0.96;
  letter-spacing: -0.03em;

}
.kbs-line .verb {
  color: #ff5b2e; /* exactly one accent hue */
}
.kbs-metronome {

}
.kbs-metronome i {
  width: 6px;
  height: 28px;
  background: #ff5b2e;
  opacity: 0.25;
}
```

```js
// ONE tempo grid drives everything — phrases AND the metronome read it.
const PULSE = 0.4; // seconds per sub-beat
const BEATS = [PULSE * 1, PULSE * 5, PULSE * 9]; // phrase onsets, on the grid

// Distinct entrances per phrase (NOT one reused helper).
tl.fromTo(
  "#p1",
  { scale: 1.5, filter: "blur(16px)", opacity: 0 },
  { scale: 1, filter: "blur(0px)", opacity: 1, duration: 0.5, ease: "power4.out" },
  BEATS[0],
);
tl.fromTo(
  "#p2",
  { x: -320, opacity: 0 },
  { x: 0, opacity: 1, duration: 0.45, ease: "expo.out" },
  BEATS[1],
);
tl.fromTo(
  "#p3",
  { y: 90, rotation: 6, opacity: 0 },
  { y: 0, rotation: 0, opacity: 1, duration: 0.55, ease: "circ.out" },
  BEATS[2],
);

// Rhythm chrome: each tick flashes on the SAME grid, not a magic offset.
gsap.utils.toArray(".kbs-metronome i").forEach((tick, i) => {
  tl.to(tick, { opacity: 1, duration: 0.08, yoyo: true, repeat: 1, ease: "none" }, PULSE * (i + 1));
});

// Finale hold: floor (not ceil) so the repeat never overshoots data-duration;
// max(0,…) so a short hold never yields a negative repeat (GSAP reads negative as -1 = infinite).
const holdStart = BEATS[2] + 0.7,
  cycle = 1.6,
  holdDur = SCENE_DURATION - holdStart;
tl.to(
  ".kbs-stage",
  {
    scale: 1.01,
    duration: cycle / 2,
    ease: "sine.inOut",
    yoyo: true,
    repeat: Math.max(0, Math.floor(holdDur / cycle) - 1),
  },
  holdStart,
);
```

## Variations

- **Entrance easing by attack character** — `power4.out` hard slam ⭐ default hit · `expo.out` hardest snap (side-snaps, whip-ins) · `back.out(2)` overshoot pop (accents only, not body words) · `circ.out` heavy rise with momentum. Use **at least 3 distinct easings** across the piece.
- **Rhythm chrome alternatives** — a center beat bar or a `// label` monospace tag pulsing on-beat instead of the 5-tick metronome; mark any decorative that must survive a shader transition per `../../transitions/overview.md`.
- **Finale dressing** — stack + accent underline sweep ([css-marker-patterns](css-marker-patterns.md)); don't just leave the last phrase sitting.

| entrance duration | 0.35–0.6s            | the hit must resolve before the next beat; exits ≤0.25s                                      |

| display face      | 150px+, heavy weight | Archivo Black / League Gothic / Oswald — see `hyperframes-creative/references/typography.md` |

## Critical Constraints

- **One beat array, not scattered offsets** — every element times off `BEATS[]` / `PULSE`; this is the single biggest lever for "rhythmic".
- **Different entrance per phrase** — a reused `punchIn()` for all lines is the flat-but-competent tell. Vary the motion axis, reuse the ease _family_.
- **Finale repeat math**: `repeat: Math.max(0, Math.floor(dur / cycle) - 1)` — `Math.ceil` overshoots `data-duration` and trips the `gsap_repeat_ceil_overshoot` lint rule; a negative repeat is read by GSAP as `-1` (infinite).
- **No banned exit animations between scenes** — in a montage the _transition_ is the exit (`../../transitions/overview.md`); only a final scene may fade out.
- **Display font must be embedded** or it silently falls back at render — Anton / Bebas-as-literal are NOT embedded (`Bebas Neue` aliases to League Gothic; verify in `typography.md`).

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

## Values

| token             | range                                   | notes                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
