## Frame 2 — One tap. One plan.

- scene: The 47 tabs crush inward and become a single FamHop plan card; the wordmark lands
- duration: 5s
- transition_in: cut
- status: built
- src: compositions/frames/02-one-plan.html
- type: product_intro
- persuasion: Negative contrast
- beat: relief
- blueprint: logo-assemble-lockup (Adapt)
- focal: assets/logo-famhop.svg
- roles: logo-famhop.svg = cutout (the lockup the whole shot resolves onto; inline the SVG so `currentColor` and `var(--accent)` resolve — set `--accent: #DD6A1A`, never an `<img>`)
- sfx: none
- on_screen: "ONE TAP." / "ONE PLAN." → resolves to the product's own line "THIS WEEKEND'S PLAN, READY TO GO" with the famhop wordmark
- asset_candidates: assets/logo-famhop.svg — the famhop wordmark, inlined as SVG

narrativeRole: The value claim, landing on beat 2 exactly as the spine requires. The crush is the video's signature move — it must read as 47 things becoming one thing, in one continuous motion, inside this frame. Frame 1 ends holding the tab wall and this frame opens on the same wall in the same positions, so the hard cut is invisible and the collapse plays here.
keyMessage: The same weekend, without the 47 tabs.

Adapt: keep the signature "the mark comes to exist, built from parts that clear the stage and
assemble." Changed: the parts are frame 1's chip wall (same positions, so the frame boundary is
invisible), and what assembles is the plan card plus the wordmark rather than an abstract mark.
**This is the video's signature beat — do not downgrade the crush to a fade.**

Scene 1 (0.0–1.3s): opens on frame 1's chip wall at its exact final positions. Every chip converges on one center point, shrinking and shedding opacity as it travels (`scale-swap-transition`), the fastest chips carrying directional velocity blur (`motion-blur-streak`). Centered convergence, 3 depth layers.
Scene 2 (1.3–2.2s): the convergence point resolves into the plan card, arriving at the same screen center the chips died on (`card-morph-anchor`) — build the seam as an **inverse zoom-through** (`cut-catalog.md`), which reads as "arriving at". Card centered, ~45% of frame.
Scene 3 (2.2–3.4s): "ONE TAP." lands above the card on one beat, "ONE PLAN." in accent-orange on the next (`kinetic-beat-slam`); the card's inverted ink kicker wipes in along its own width.
Scene 4 (3.4–5.0s): the famhop wordmark draws itself on beneath the card, stroke by stroke (`svg-path-draw`), the pin-o filling accent-orange last. Then held — no drift, no breathing.

# Card Morph Anchor

A free-floating container morphs apparent size, corner radius, and surface treatment between two shots — the morph itself IS the transition; the viewer's eye tracks the persistent container. Distinct from [anchored-layout-expand.md](anchored-layout-expand.md) (an edge-pinned live layout participant that grows along one axis and reflows neighbors — here nothing is pushed) and [theme-crossfade-morph.md](theme-crossfade-morph.md) (a whole-theme reskin under a fixed anchor — here a single container changes shape).

## How It Works

Since `width`/`height` tweens are forbidden, **substitute uniform `scale` for apparent size**; the remaining morph channels are **paint-only**: `borderRadius`, `background`, `boxShadow`. All channels ride ONE tween (one ease, one duration) so the shape morphs in lockstep. Content choreography: old content fades out during the first ~40% of the morph, new content fades in during the last ~40% — the shape-only gap between is the natural "blink." Optionally the morph card itself fades at the very end, revealing the real next-shot element rendered behind it.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<!-- DOM order = stacking: the anchor renders BEFORE the card, so the card is on top -->
<div class="next-shot-anchor"><img src="{nextShotAnchor}" alt="anchor" /></div>
<div class="morph-card">
  <div class="content-old">{shotOneContent}</div>
  <div class="content-new">{shotTwoContent}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.morph-card {
  width: SHOT_ONE_W;
  height: SHOT_ONE_H; /* shot-1 geometry; the morph is scale, never width/height */
  border-radius: SHOT_ONE_RADIUS;
  background: {surfaceShotOne};
  overflow: hidden; /* content must clip during the shape change */
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  will-change: transform;
}
.content-old,
.content-new {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
.content-new {
  opacity: 0; /* author its inner sizes at apparent-size ÷ END_SCALE — it scales with the card */
}
.next-shot-anchor {
  position: absolute;
  opacity: 0; /* fades in as the morph card fades out */
}
```

```js
const END_SCALE = SHOT_TWO_W / SHOT_ONE_W; // uniform — keep the two shots aspect-matched

// Hold shot 1 for HOLD_BEAT first — an instant morph reads as glitchy.

// One tween, all channels: uniform scale + paint-only properties.
tl.to(
  ".morph-card",
  {
    scale: END_SCALE,
    borderRadius: SHOT_TWO_RADIUS / END_SCALE, // borderRadius is pre-scale — divide to land the APPARENT radius
    background: "{surfaceShotTwo}",
    boxShadow: "{shadowShotTwo}",
    duration: MORPH_DUR,
    ease: "power2.inOut",
  },
  MORPH_START,
);

tl.to(
  ".content-old",
  { opacity: 0, duration: MORPH_DUR * OLD_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.in" },
  MORPH_START,
);
tl.to(
  ".content-new",
  { opacity: 1, duration: MORPH_DUR * NEW_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.out" },
  MORPH_START + MORPH_DUR * (1 - NEW_FADE_FRAC),
);

// Optional handoff — card fades out over the pixel-identical real anchor.
tl.to(
  ".morph-card",
  { opacity: 0, duration: MORPH_DUR * FINAL_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.in", immediateRender: false },
  MORPH_START + MORPH_DUR * (1 - FINAL_FADE_FRAC),
);
tl.to(
  ".next-shot-anchor",
  { opacity: 1, duration: MORPH_DUR * FINAL_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.out" },
  MORPH_START + MORPH_DUR * (1 - FINAL_FADE_FRAC),
);
```

## Morph channels

| channel        | how                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| apparent size  | uniform `scale` — the substitution for the forbidden `width`/`height` tween; aspect preserved  |
| `borderRadius` | paint-only; pre-scale units — tween to `APPARENT_RADIUS / END_SCALE`, ≤ half the smaller side  |
| `background`   | paint-only; gradients interpolate only with equal stop counts (solid→solid: `backgroundColor`) |
| `boxShadow`    | paint-only; base shadow → accent glow shifts emphasis                                          |

## Variations

- **Landing on a non-centered target** (dock icon, sidebar slot): add `x`/`y` to the same tween, computed as the FLIP-style delta between the card's and the target's rects — `getBoundingClientRect()` both at build time (single-scene only, per the contract) and tween the difference. Don't hand-compute from CSS values: paddings, borders, and parent transforms compound, and center-vs-edge arithmetic is the classic off-by-half bug.
- **Aspect change between shots**: uniform scale preserves aspect — morph to the nearest uniform fit and let the crossfade/handoff absorb the small delta, or drop the handoff and hold the card's final state.

## Values

| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| HOLD_BEAT         | 0.6–1.5s                  | ≥ shot 1's entry settle; the viewer must register shot 1 first                       |
| MORPH_DUR         | 0.6–1.2s                  | < 0.5s can't fit both content fades                                                  |
| END_SCALE         | SHOT_TWO_W / SHOT_ONE_W   | icon-sized handoffs typically land at 80–400px apparent width                        |
| SHOT_TWO_RADIUS   | ≤ min(W, H)/2 apparent    | half the smaller side = perfect circle; beyond is clamped                            |
| OLD/NEW_FADE_FRAC | 0.3–0.5 each, sum ≤ 1     | the gap between is the shape-only "blink"                                            |
| FINAL_FADE_FRAC   | 0 (no handoff) or 0.1–0.2 | only when a pixel-identical anchor exists                                            |
| ease              | `power2.inOut` canonical  | `power3`/`expo.inOut` OK; never `back`/`elastic` — overshoot fights the shape change |

## Critical Constraints

- **❗ Uniform-scale substitution** — never tween `width`/`height`; `scale` + the paint-only channels (`borderRadius`, `background`, `boxShadow`) are the ONLY morph properties.
- **❗ Handoff anchor must be pixel-identical to the card's final state** — same apparent size, radius, background, shadow, inner icon dimensions. Any delta = a visible pop during the crossfade. Can't match exactly? Drop the handoff and hold the morph card.
- **❗ Stacking by DOM order, never a z-index snap mid-fade** — render the anchor before the card; a `tl.set({ zIndex })` during an active opacity tween flips stacking before the fade finishes and flickers.
- **`overflow: hidden`** on the card — content must clip as the radius changes.
- **Hold a beat before morphing**; same ease family for shape and crossfade (mixed eases read unsynchronized).

# Kinetic Beat Slam

Short phrases hit one at a time on a **steady beat**, each with a _different_ entrance, then stack into a locked finale — the recipe for "punchy / rhythmic" text-forward pieces (taglines, manifestos, hype intros). The difference between generic and rhythmic is (1) one shared **onset array** driving every element, (2) **distinct** entrances per phrase rather than one reused helper, and (3) optional **rhythm chrome** that visibly keeps the beat.

## How It Works

A single tempo grid — `PULSE` seconds per sub-beat, `BEATS = [t0, t1, t2, …]` on that grid — is the rhythmic spine; every phrase entrance, accent, and chrome tick reads its time from it, so the piece locks to one pulse instead of drifting hand-tuned offsets. Each phrase gets a different transform axis (scale+blur slam / side snap / rise+rotate) with short attacks (0.35–0.6s on the hit), then the stack holds with a finite low-amplitude breath.

// Rhythm chrome: each tick flashes on the SAME grid, not a magic offset.
gsap.utils.toArray(".kbs-metronome i").forEach((tick, i) => {
  tl.to(tick, { opacity: 1, duration: 0.08, yoyo: true, repeat: 1, ease: "none" }, PULSE * (i + 1));
});

// Finale hold: floor (not ceil) so the repeat never overshoots data-duration;

  cycle = 1.6,

  },
  holdStart,
);
```

## Variations

- **Entrance easing by attack character** — `power4.out` hard slam ⭐ default hit · `expo.out` hardest snap (side-snaps, whip-ins) · `back.out(2)` overshoot pop (accents only, not body words) · `circ.out` heavy rise with momentum. Use **at least 3 distinct easings** across the piece.
- **Rhythm chrome alternatives** — a center beat bar or a `// label` monospace tag pulsing on-beat instead of the 5-tick metronome; mark any decorative that must survive a shader transition per `../../transitions/overview.md`.
- **Finale dressing** — stack + accent underline sweep ([css-marker-patterns](css-marker-patterns.md)); don't just leave the last phrase sitting.

## Critical Constraints

- **One beat array, not scattered offsets** — every element times off `BEATS[]` / `PULSE`; this is the single biggest lever for "rhythmic".
- **Different entrance per phrase** — a reused `punchIn()` for all lines is the flat-but-competent tell. Vary the motion axis, reuse the ease _family_.
- **Finale repeat math**: `repeat: Math.max(0, Math.floor(dur / cycle) - 1)` — `Math.ceil` overshoots `data-duration` and trips the `gsap_repeat_ceil_overshoot` lint rule; a negative repeat is read by GSAP as `-1` (infinite).
- **No banned exit animations between scenes** — in a montage the _transition_ is the exit (`../../transitions/overview.md`); only a final scene may fade out.
- **Display font must be embedded** or it silently falls back at render — Anton / Bebas-as-literal are NOT embedded (`Bebas Neue` aliases to League Gothic; verify in `typography.md`).

# Motion-Blur Streak

Real motion blur isn't available to a seeked renderer (it integrates over shutter time), so this rule **fakes** it for a fast fly-in or hard camera push-through. The whole point is the _coupling_: the blur envelope rides the **same ease and window** as the position tween, so peak blur lands exactly on peak speed and the element is razor-sharp the instant it stops. Two paths:

- **(A) Directional SVG blur** — inline `<feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="X 0">` (X on the motion axis, 0 across it), tweened via a proxy. Cleanest; a true directional smear.
- **(B) Echo / ghost trail** — 2–4 duplicates at decreasing opacity, offset backward along the motion vector, collapsing into the lead as it settles. No filter cost; a stylized "speed-line" trail.

**Entrances and mid-shot moves only — never a mid-composition exit.** A blurred element fleeing off-frame mid-composition reads as a glitch; a hard exit between scenes is the transition's job (`../../transitions/overview.md`). One sanctioned scope extension: the envelope may ride the **camera wrapper** during a travel leg — see the Camera-Travel Carve-Out.

## How It Works

A fast `out`-eased move front-loads velocity — fastest off the start, bleeding to zero at the settle. Map the blur/echo envelope onto that same curve: position travels from an off-frame / pushed-back start to rest over `MOVE_DUR`; in lockstep on the same window and ease the smear goes `PEAK_BLUR → 0` (A) or the ghosts collapse onto the lead (B). By the settle the element is fully crisp and dwells ≥1 s — the contrast between violent streak and still, sharp settle IS the effect. GSAP can't tween an SVG attribute directly: tween a plain `{ v }` proxy and write `setAttribute("stdDeviation", …)` in `onUpdate`, seeding it once at setup so a seek to t=0 shows the streaked start.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip; overflow: hidden on the scene (the smear extends past rest) -->
<svg width="0" height="0" aria-hidden="true" style="position: absolute">
  <filter id="streak" x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%">
    <feGaussianBlur id="streak-blur" in="SourceGraphic" stdDeviation="0 0" />
  </filter>
</svg>
<div class="streak-el" id="streak-el" style="filter: url(#streak)">{phrase}</div>
<!-- Path B instead: N-1 aria-hidden .streak-ghost duplicates BEHIND the lead, no filter -->
```

```js
// Path A — proxy-tweened directional blur.
const blurNode = document.getElementById("streak-blur");
const blurProxy = { v: PEAK_BLUR };
const writeBlur = () => blurNode.setAttribute("stdDeviation", `${blurProxy.v} 0`); // X axis only
writeBlur(); // seed frame 0 — a seek to t=0 must show the streaked start, not a sharp pre-frame

tl.fromTo(
  "#streak-el",
  { x: ENTER_FROM_X, opacity: 0 },
  { x: 0, opacity: 1, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE },
  MOVE_START,
);
tl.to(blurProxy, { v: 0, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE, onUpdate: writeBlur }, MOVE_START);

// Path B — ghosts on the SAME window/ease; per-ghost variation by index.
gsap.utils.toArray(".streak-ghost").forEach((g) => {
  const i = Number(g.dataset.i); // 1..N-1, set in HTML
  tl.fromTo(
    g,
    { x: ENTER_FROM_X - i * ECHO_STEP_PX, opacity: GHOST_BASE_OPACITY / i },
    { x: 0, opacity: 0, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE },
    MOVE_START,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Vertical streak** — swap axes: `y`, `stdDeviation="0 Y"`, vertical echo offsets.
- **Camera push-through** — `scale: SCALE_FROM → 1` with a symmetric `"B B"` envelope (depth-wise smear, not directional): the wordmark punches out of soft focus and snaps crisp at the lock.
- **Staggered grid streak-in** — each card streaks into its slot at `MOVE_START + i * CARD_STAGGER` with its own blur proxy / ghosts; sharp the instant it lands.
- **Hold-the-streak** — blur on a marginally slower curve than position (position `expo.out`, blur `power3.out`) so the last wisp resolves just after arrival. Sparingly; default is locked envelopes.

## Camera-Travel Carve-Out

The envelope is also sanctioned at **wrapper level**: on the `.world` / camera wrapper of a virtual-camera scene ([viewport-change.md](viewport-change.md), [multi-phase-camera.md](multi-phase-camera.md), [3d-camera-flight.md](3d-camera-flight.md)) during a **travel leg** — a dive, a whip sweep, a violent final push. This does **not** violate "never a mid-composition exit": the world never leaves frame — the camera travels _through_ it, and every leg ends with the world at rest, sharp, inside the frame. Each leg is an **arrival** at the next pose, so the entrance doctrine applies leg by leg. Three deltas from the element-level recipe:

- **Envelope follows the leg's ease.** An `out` leg (dive, final push) uses the base recipe unchanged. An `inOut` repositioning leg peaks mid-leg: split the envelope at the velocity peak — `0 → PEAK` on the in-half ease over the first half, `PEAK → 0` on the out-half over the second. Seed the proxy at **0** for these (the streaked state lives mid-leg, not at t=0; seed-at-`PEAK_BLUR` belongs to the entrance shape, where the first frame IS the fastest).
- **Filter placement.** 2D camera: `filter: url(#streak)` on the `.world` wrapper. 3D flight: on the **perspective stage** above the 3D context — a `filter` on a `preserve-3d` element flattens it and collapses every `translateZ`. Never per-element inside the world: one frame-wide envelope, not N desynced ones.
- **Full-frame blur is heavy** — cap `PEAK_BLUR` ~18–20 at wrapper level (vs 30 for one element); a brief whip may touch ~24. Axis rule as usual: `"X 0"` for a lateral whip/pan, `"B B"` for a dive/push.

### Whip sweep (named composition)

The heavily-blurred lateral whip that resolves into the next region — two rules on one window:

1. **Position** — [nudge-curve.md](nudge-curve.md)'s three-phase chain on the camera state, tuned burst-dominant (tail still ≥3× ramp-in in time).
2. **Blur** — `0 → PEAK` across the ramp-in, held at `PEAK` through the linear burst (constant velocity = constant smear), `PEAK → 0` across the tail.

Swap or reveal the next region's content DURING the burst — the smear masks the change; the `power4.out` tail lands it sharp. Reveal during the burst, read after the tail.

```js
tl.to(cam, { x: WHIP_X * 0.1, duration: 0.12, ease: "power3.in", onUpdate: applyCamera }, WHIP_AT);
tl.to(
  cam,
  { x: WHIP_X * 0.75, duration: 0.1, ease: "none", onUpdate: applyCamera },
  WHIP_AT + 0.12,
);
tl.to(
  cam,
  { x: WHIP_X, duration: 0.35, ease: "power4.out", onUpdate: applyCamera },
  WHIP_AT + 0.22,
);

tl.to(blurProxy, { v: PEAK_BLUR, duration: 0.12, ease: "power3.in", onUpdate: writeBlur }, WHIP_AT);
// blur holds at PEAK through the linear burst (no tween needed — value rests at PEAK)
tl.to(blurProxy, { v: 0, duration: 0.35, ease: "power4.out", onUpdate: writeBlur }, WHIP_AT + 0.22);

## Critical Constraints

- Blur peaks at peak speed and resolves to 0 at the settle — share the ease and window between position and envelope. A blur that lingers after the stop reads as a focus pull.
- Entrances / mid-shot arrivals only — never a mid-composition exit; wrapper-level use only per the carve-out.
- Seed `stdDeviation` at setup: at `PEAK_BLUR` for the entrance shape, at 0 for a whip / `inOut` leg.
- Generous filter region (`x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%"`) or the smear clips at the element's box edge.
- Directional axis: `"X 0"` horizontal, `"0 Y"` vertical, `"B B"` only for a depth/scale move — symmetric blur on a sideways move looks like defocus.
- Dwell ≥1 s sharp after the snap; a streak landing at the last beat reads as "flashed and gone".
- Heavy element on a solid field — thin type (< ~120px / 800 weight) or a busy backdrop swallows the smear.
- `overflow: hidden` on the scene — the smear / furthest ghost extends past the resting position during travel.

# Scale-Swap Transition

Simulates a "morph" between two DOM elements by overlapping exit and entrance scale animations. Lighter weight than [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (which morphs container dimensions — use that for SHAPE changes; this rule is for SAME-shape state swaps) and easier than SVG path interpolation.

At a single trigger, two coordinated tweens fire:

1. **Outgoing**: scale `1.0 → EXIT_SCALE` + opacity `1 → 0`, fast `power2.in` (rushing away).
2. **Incoming**: scale `EXIT_SCALE → 1.0` + opacity `0 → 1`, `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` (arriving with weight).

A small `OVERLAP` window during which both are mid-tween creates the morph illusion; the incoming sits on top via z-index so the outgoing's fade-tail doesn't bleed through.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Both cards position: absolute; inset: 0 in one fixed-size wrapper — same
     footprint, same transform-origin: 50% 50%. Incoming starts opacity: 0,
     transform: scale(EXIT_SCALE), z-index above the outgoing. -->
<div class="swap-wrap">
  <div class="card outgoing" id="outgoing">{outgoingIcon} {outgoingLabel}</div>
  <div class="card incoming" id="incoming">
    {incomingIcon} {incomingLabel}
    <div class="sub" id="sub">{incomingSubline}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// Outgoing: shrink + fade fast
tl.to(
  "#outgoing",
  { scale: EXIT_SCALE, opacity: 0, duration: EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.in" },
  TRIGGER,
);

// Incoming: pops in with overshoot, starting OVERLAP before the exit finishes
tl.to(
  "#incoming",
  { scale: 1.0, opacity: 1, duration: ENTER_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR - OVERLAP,
);

// Inner content reveals AFTER the incoming settles
tl.fromTo(
  "#sub",
  { opacity: 0, y: SUB_REVEAL_Y_PX },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUB_REVEAL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR + SUB_REVEAL_DELAY,
);
```

## Variations

- **Delayed inner content reveal** — the classic pattern above: morph the container, then reveal inner text once it settles; the 0.2–0.4 s gap lets the eye land on the new shape before reading.
- **Triple swap (3-state cycle)** — chain A→B→C with triggers `TRIGGER_AB` / `TRIGGER_BC`; each transition is its own tween pair, the previous incoming becoming the next outgoing. State-evolution narratives (early → mid → final labels).
- **Color-shift transition (no scale)** — for a flat morph between same-shape states, drop the scale and keep opacity + a brief background hue tween; less dramatic, more product-UI tone.

## Critical Constraints

- **Incoming z-index ABOVE outgoing** — otherwise the outgoing's fade-tail (opacity 0.3–0.5) bleeds through and double-exposes the frame.
- **Both elements share `transform-origin: 50% 50%`** — different origins make the morph read as one thing teleporting elsewhere.
- **Bouncy ease ONLY on the incoming** — outgoing `power2.in`, incoming `back.out`; reversed, the swap feels mechanical.
- **Both cards `position: absolute; inset: 0`** in the same fixed-size wrapper (sized to fit both states; the wrap never resizes).
- **Don't `display: none` the outgoing** after the fade — leave it at `opacity: 0` so layout doesn't reflow.
- **Inner content reveals after the container settles**; **climax dwell ≥ 1 s** after the final state + subline land.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
